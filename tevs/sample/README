File tevs_normal.py will process files named with the "normal" convention.
It reads tevs.cfg for path information, expecting to find 1,000 files in
each directory from unproc/tmp_000 to unproc/tmp_xyz.  

Results are written to results as well as to a Postgresql database.  

Processed files are moved from unproc to proc.

You will need to move the hum20101102 tree and adjust the paths in 
tevs.cfg in order to explore.
